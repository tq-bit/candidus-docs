So you better make a good first impression.</p><p>Candidus takes an opinionated, minimalistic approach to keep your audience&#39;s attention:</p><ul><li>No overloaded index page. First imressions matter, so it&#39;s the page&#39;s banner or featured posts, not both.</li><li>Many custom features are disabled by default to make the most of site speed.
