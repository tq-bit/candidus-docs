# About the theme

Thank you for taking the time to read how Candidus to be! We spent lots of time thinking every component of the theme through and hope you're happy with the final result.

Candidus, translated from latin, means as much as 'white', 'bright' or 'open'. Its name emphasizes the theme's philosophy. We've built Candidus around three core pillars, using modern design principles and web technologies.

## 1. Spotlight the content, don't steal the show

[It takes a visitor of your website 50 milliseconds to decide whether they'll keep reading](https://cxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/#:~:text=People%20make%20snap%20judgments.,they'll%20stay%20or%20leave.). So you better make a good first impression.

Candidus takes an opinionated, minimalistic approach to keep your audience's attention:

- No overloaded index page. It's the page's banner or featured posts, not both.
- No fancy features ([that is, unless you want to](#3-maximize-user-experience-empower-the-publisher))
- Three theme colors. One from Ghost, two from Candidus

## 2. Let it shine, keep it simple

Candidus provides a flat, grid-based layout and emphasizes your content where it's necessary. All theme pages are trimmed to highlight your publication's message and make use of Ghost's fantastic built-in features.

## 3. Peak user experience, empower the publisher

If your audience is more sophisticated, you'll want to keep them engaged. Candidus comes with several feautres you can opt-in for in your administration panel.
